Assistant orchestration.  ARCHITECTURE.md §4.4 / IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §C7.

Two execution paths, ONE validator:

  claude         -- real tool-calling loop via the Anthropic SDK tool runner.
  deterministic  -- an intent router that calls the same tools and renders
                    templates. Used when no API key is configured, and as the
                    on-stage fallback the plan requires (§10: never stake the
                    demo on a live API call).

Both paths end at validator.validate(). The guarantee -- no number reaches the
user unless a tool produced it -- holds identically either way.
